# Welcome to the Marketing Committee
The marketing committee is here to help spread the message of openness in the .NET ecosystem. We support community and project initiatives, drive  awareness and increase membership. We create consistent, powerful storytelling to increase share of conversation and establish industry relevance for the .NET Foundation.   

View the [.NET Foundation slide deck](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/:p:/s/Marketing/EbxGONyybLRMoe6MgPNUEi4BdDuEWNLmdfV_s8INO9nWTw?e=mImEov) and use it to help us spread the word!

Do you have a piece of content or news you'd like us to promote? Any member can submit to the [monthly newsletter & blog](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/website/blob/master/input/blog/posts/_current-newsletter-draft.md), or [request content for social amplification](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/content) via our Twitter and Facebook social channels.

## Marketing Proposals
Members can secure funds from the .NET Foundation Marketing Committee to perform marketing activities and drive initiatives that align to our goals and priorities. See [Proposals](proposals.md) for more information. 


## Assets 
Many marketing assets are binary in nature (slides, spreadsheets, graphics & branding, trademark docs, etc.) and some are not meant to be publicized broadly. For these, marketing committee members have access to https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/sites/Marketing.
