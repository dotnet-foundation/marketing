### Store Update

The Marketing Committee discussed the .NET Store updates. The Committee received a $10,000 donation from Microsoft for new T-shirts. They plan to merge the Xamarin Store with the .NET Foundation Store. 

### Website Status

The marketing committee has been leading an initiative to update the website design and use a hosted CMS so that non-developers on our committees can easily and quickly add and modify content and so that the design of the site looks more professional. We are looking at WordPress and Sitefinity (a .NET solution from Progress). Our goal is to have a new website by end of fiscal year. 

Beth Massi provided a website status update. She and Shawn Wildermuth met with the Virtual web team last week. Virtual will propose a project plan and cost of hosting the site in WordPress. The Marketing Committee is leaning towards Sitefinity if it will be an in-kind donation. 

ACTIONS:
- Beth Massi to send an email regarding the website update to the Board of Directors. 
-  Sara Faatz to contact Beth Massi to discuss the website update.

### .NET Survey Results

The Marketing Committee reviewed the .NET Survey results. The survey received over 4500 responses. The Marketing Committee will work asynchronously to publish the results.
