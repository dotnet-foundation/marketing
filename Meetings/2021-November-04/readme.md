## Introduction

Isaac Levin, the Marketing Committee Chair, gave a quick introduction and outlined some agenda items.

## Open Discussion: Board Feedback

How can the marketing committee leverage news from projects that are part of the foundation? Best strategy may be to utilize social media channels. With that in mind, Isaac Levin discussed the marketing committee having an issue template. Beth Massi noted that the committee already has one, but committee members agreed that it could be advertised better. The committee also discussed the board feedback around focus on non-Microsoft centered events, particularly internationally where .Net can have a wider reach.

## Open Discussion: Website Update

Shawn Wildermuth spoke the possibility of using Rich text in the short term for the members of committees that do not have technical backgrounds. This would be a short-term solution until the evaluation of long-term CMS’ is finished. We would also be able to easily implement this on top of what we already have, and the data would all be stored in GitHub.

The committee agreed that long term, the goal of the CMS would be the enablement of dynamic content on foundation website as well as having a user interface to design the website. Isaac Levin suggested we restart the evaluation process with the two CMS providers, Umbraco and Sitefinity and WordPress
