## .NET Foundation "State of .NET" survey results

We launched a "State of .NET" survey in November that closed on March 31, 2021. Thank you to all who participated. Your feedback is very important to the .NET Foundation. We collected 4,509 responses. This was the first survey ever done by the .NET Foundation to the .NET developer community and we will continue to do them every year going forward. 

The survey was conducted via SurveyMonkey and you can [view the reports here](https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-GDSVMB2C/).

The raw data is available in the file in this repo `2021-dotNETFoundation-Survey-Results.csv`
