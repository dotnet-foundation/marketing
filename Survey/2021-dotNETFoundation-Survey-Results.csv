It is crucial to embrace community work and consider carefully how to make projects that are key and important part of the ecosystem feel belonged and that their work matters. ," Being trumped by a new MSFT project is disheartening, and even if unfair, can encourage people to leave the ecosystem.  Dapper, being trumped by Dapr, winget and appget, etc.  Even if there are two sides to the stories, the general consensus and FUD trumps the truth in many cases.    Standing up for community within MSFT and making the larger MSFT aware of what they are stomping on would be a good first step.  Second would be seeing the .NET foundation more strongly explain what and how they are going to improve the ecosystem.

It implies that the project is high quality. However to be honest, I don't really know too much about the .NET Foundation. My understanding is that its purpose is to help promote the .NET ecosystem by providing resources and infrastructure to .NET Foundation projects.","1. The .NET ecosystem has bad docs docs. For example, the Mono.Cecil project has 2K GitHub stars and 9M downloads. However, this project has minimal docs. Other ecosystems like Rust has docs.rs for all Cargo packages, or Dart has documentation automatically generated for all packages on pub.dev. We need this experience for the .NET ecosystem. In my opinion, the docs.microsoft.com platform should be available to all NuGet packages. It should be *easy* to create wonderful docs for your .NET project.    Also, please compare the docs for Laravel (PHP's web framework) and ASP.NET Core. Laravel's docs are written for newbies: they're approachable and avoid jargon. ASP.NET Core's docs are incredibly technical and expect you to be an expert.    2. The .NET ecosystem does not evangelize itself well compared to other ecosystems.

Do more to improve the .Net ecosystem ， today we create a .net app , and will require to install java (because some service need java saas) so why we just using java ?   we need you to tell us that .net is your need , instead of .net is an option.  5. forcing on  native lanague and  mixed compile,  make .net do less to consume native .dll/.so/.dylib  6. take .net to non-jit mode  or  create non-jit mode in .Net ,  give us the  cross platform  Assembly language in .net.  so many component can directly write in .net language and compile in .net   instead of the need of C++ or other lanague compiler  7.  give us the  typed dynamic type like typescript and javascript  instead of just `dynamic ` without intellsence ( dynamic script powered by a  interpreter  instead of the DLR, that provide fast execute) .    future is  native and dynamic that mixed, you use native lanague feature to be more efficient  for the area need height performance  and  write less code and do more for build app faster.

If that is the case, it is a very well-resourced project that should help any .NET developer sharpen their techniques with the latest and the greatest .NET technologies.","Everything about DotNet always comes out as ""half-baked"".  I expect the foundation to find the middle ground with Microsoft and ensure that base features are always handled right away.      e.g., We were waiting for a long time to have OData .NET Core support. Finally, they implemented a workaround. The moment it started to work, the latest EntityFrameworkCore update broke it again for `applyto` & `groupby` due to a breaking change (no more client-side evaluation). Even today, we are still not having any workaround or fix, which means no real OData developer can use EntityFrameworkCore.    Unfortunately, some technologies should be considered as the first citizen. ENTITYFRAMEWORK, MSTEST, DOCFX, ODATA, RESTIER, these things should not be in a broken state for more than a month or two. And there should be constant communication about the progress.  Again, I'm not talking about the ""feature"" implementations here.    Things are always causing issues, and what I expect from the foundation is to be our voice.    Another example is DOCFX, a great feature to have. Still, no proper streamlined documentation exists on how to deploy it through .NET CORE and GitHub Actions.  It is fundamental for a .NET developer to compete with the JavaScript world. I expect the foundation to arrange resources to ensure .NET technology documentation, Get Started, and Advanced example projects always exist and up-to-date from day 1.

I think there's still a ways to go before .NET has the respect in the world that it deserves since .NET Core 2.x (especially so in .NET 5). I've worked in a few organizations that were split on Python & .NET. The perception of .NET from the Python side still needs some help. I think some relationship with the CNCF could potentially help here.,"I think it could be useful if Microsoft research-type projects went through an incubation process similar to how Apache & CNCF run. There have been a lot of technologies coming out of MS whose community could have benefitted from an open/external process (Dapr, Orleans, ML.NET, Spark.NET). There have been a handful of technologies that came out of MS that are amazing but had a weird evolution (Reactive Extensions, TPL Dataflow) where from the outside it was difficult to tell how committed Microsoft was to them.    I think the buzz around CNCF-type technologies is something MS really needs to focus on. In order for adoption of .NET to catch on, it can't all revolve around selling Azure services all the time.  OpenTelemetry/System.Diagnostics.Activity is a cool story in this regard, but its buried in Github pull requests.  You/MS would earn some good will to emphasize how it can be used with Datadog, Prometheus, InfluxDB, ELK, etc..",Strongly approve,Agree,Strongly agree,5,3,1,2,4,6,Maintainer (leads an open source project),"Contributor (contributes code, logs issues, etc.)",Consumer (downloads and uses),,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Male,,North America,,"Over $150,000",201-500,Nov-50,15 to 19 years,,,,,,"Developer, backend",,"Developer, enterprise",,,,,"Developer, DevOps",,Site engineer,,,,,,

Seeing a project has the backing of the .NET Foundation instills confidence that the project will have the support it needs to have a longevity and lifecycle that will support both the needs of businesses leveraging the projects and supporting the creators who have poured their passion into these projects but who often times are maintaining the software as a hobby in their spare time. ","In scenarios where projects that are not yet part of the .NET Foundation are in need of resources, such as the maintainer no longer being able to work on the project, it would be nice to see the .NET Foundation step in and use it's resources to help these projects stay afloat and gain broader community support, particularly for popular projects. As a recent example, Caliburn.Micro receives hundreds of downloads a day on NuGet, but as the main project developer has stepped down, the path forward for the library remains unclear and an organized group with experience like the .NET Foundation could help correct the course by amplifying that need for community support and moving the project under the wing of the .NET Foundation.",Strongly approve,Strongly agree,Strongly agree,5,4,2,3,1,6,,"Contributor (contributes code, logs issues, etc.)",Consumer (downloads and uses),,,No,Yes,Yes,Yes,,Yes,,Male,,North America,,"Between $100,000 and $150,000","10,000+",51-100,15 to 19 years,,,,,,"Developer, backend",,"Developer, enterprise",,,,,"Developer, DevOps",,,,,,,,
